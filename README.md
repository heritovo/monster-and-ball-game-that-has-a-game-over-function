# monster-and-ball-game-that-has-a-game-over-function
In this example, let's make use of a global gameState variable for managing the life-cycle of the game. Usually, there is a main menu with a "start new game" option, then we play the game, and if we 'die' we suffer a game-over screen, etc...

You and me think that this game would be too easy if there was only one ball added every time the monster collides with the balls. That's why the reverse makes more sense. 
A player should have a "dead" state that way the game seems more challenging in addition to the levels that are already present.
